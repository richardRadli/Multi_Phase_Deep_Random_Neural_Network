# Overview



## üìö Datasets
Datasets that are employed in our article can be found on the website of 
<a href="https://www.example.com/my great page">UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>.

To convert them to appropriate format, use the python file called _convert_datasets.py_.

Or datasets can be downloaded from <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fe3DjPOGgzNmlnJj0yn0WTUazh3ojL8k/view?usp=drive_link">here<a/>.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
Make sure you have the following packages installed:

```bash
colorlog~=6.8.2
matplotlib~=3.8.1
numpy~=1.26.4
pandas~=2.1.0
sklearn==1.4.0
torch~=2.2.1+cu121
torchvision~=0.17.1+cu121
tqdm~=4.66.2
scikit-learn~=1.4.0
colorama~=0.4.6
jsonschema~=4.23.0
torchinfo~=1.8.0
```
## üöÄ Installation

### 1. Clone or download the repository
Begin by cloning or downloading this repository to your local machine.

### 2. Update configuration
Open the _data_paths.py_ file. You will find the following dictionary:

```python
root_mapping = {
    'ricsi': {
        "STORAGE_ROOT":
            "D:/storage/Journal2",
        "DATASET_ROOT":
            "D:/storage/Journal2/datasets",
        "PROJECT_ROOT":
            "C:/Users/ricsi/Documents/research/Multi_Phase_Deep_Random_Neural_Network",
    }
}
```

You have to replace the username (in this case 'ricsi') with your own. Your username cane be acquired by running the `whoami` command in your terminal to retrieve it.

#### PROJECT_ROOT
- Update this path to the directory where the Python scripts and JSON files of the project are located. This directory will be used as the central repository for essential files.
#### DATASET_ROOT: 
- Modify this path to point to the directory where your datasets are stored. This folder should contain all datasets necessary for the project.
#### STORAGE_ROOT: 
- Adjust this path to the location where you want to save project outputs and other data generated during the execution of the project.

### 3. Create necessary folders
Run the __data_paths.py__ script. This will create all the required folders based on the paths specified in the configuration.

### 4. Download and place datasets
Obtain the necessary datasets and place them into the DATASET_ROOT directory as specified in your updated configuration.

## Usage
### Setting Up Configuration Files
Before running the Python scripts, you need to configure your settings by preparing the following JSON and Python files:
- Configuration for the FCNN (FCNN_config.json)
- Configuration for the HELM (HELM_config.json)
- Configuration for the IPMPDRNN (IPMPDRNN_config.json)
- Configuration for the MPDRNN (MPDRNN_config.json)


Once your configuration files are set up, run the Python scripts to train and test.

### Workflow
- Optional: It is advisable to run hyperparameter tuning, although config files contain the best settings.
  - There is a separate file for hyperparameter tuning for all available networks. 
- After tuning, you may execute the training and evaluation for the desired network.
  - To train and evaluate the FCNN network, run __execute_test.py__ in the fcnn folder.
  - To train and evaluate the HELM network, run __helm.py__ in the helm folder.
  - To train and evaluate the MPDRNN network, run __mpdrnn.py__ in the mpdrnn folder.
